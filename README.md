[IMPORTANT] How to run the website:

Due to some privacy settings in modern day browsers, the data of 3d models would not be passed through the debugger.

1) So, the user had to create a localhost and then run the files. To do that download XAMPP software from given link:
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

2) After downloading go to location => C:\xampp\htdocs
3) Then create a new folder "test".

4) Inside the 'test' folder, copy this entire github directory inside a new folder with name, "Sample_Website".
5) Open the XAMPP localhost control panel. From there run the "Apache" server.
6) To run the code, go to a web browser(prefer chrome) and type this in navigation bar :
http://localhost/test/Sample_Website/Home_Page.html

Everything can be accessed from Home_Page.html
